Unable to establish a connection to adb.

Check the Event Log for possible issues.
This can happen if you have an incompatible version of adb running already,
or if localhost is pointing to the wrong address.
Try re-opening Studio after killing any existing adb daemons and verifying that your
localhost entry is pointing to 127.0.0.1 or ::1 for IPv4 or IPv6, respectively.

If this happens repeatedly, please file a bug at http://b.android.com including the following:
  1. Output of the command: 'C:\Users\riyad\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe devices'
  2. Your idea.log file (Help | Show Log in Explorer)
